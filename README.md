## Technologies Used

StepinFlow leverages the following technologies and libraries:

- [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/): The core framework for building cross-platform applications.
- [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/): An object-relational mapper (ORM) for database operations.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): A lightweight, file-based database system.
- [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/): A convention-based object-to-object mapper for .NET.
- [OpenCvSharp](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp): A .NET wrapper for the OpenCV computer vision library.
- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/): A UI framework for building Windows desktop applications.
- [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/data/mvvm): An architectural pattern for separating UI logic from business logic in WPF applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit).
- No additional runtime installation requiredâ€”StepinFlow is self-contained!

### Installation
1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/alekoundas/StepinFlow/releases) page.
2. Download the latest `StepinFlow-Portable-win-x64-vX.X.X.zip` file (e.g., `v1.0.106`).
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice.
4. Run `StepinFlow.exe` to launch the app.

### Usage
1. **Create a Flow**: Use the TreeView interface to define a new workflow.
2. **Add Steps**: Add individual steps and parameters to your flow.
3. **Execute**: Run your flow and track its progress in real-time.
4. **Save & Reuse**: Save workflows to the SQLite database for later use.

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (or later) with Desktop Development workload

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alekoundas/StepinFlow.git
    cd StepinFlow
    ```

2. Restore dependencies:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore StepinFlow.sln
    ```

3. Build the solution:
    ```bash
    dotnet build StepinFlow.sln --configuration Release
    ```

## Available Flow Step Types

StepinFlow offers a variety of flow step types tailored for automating GUI interactions and screen-based workflows. Below is a list of available step types with their descriptions:

- **WAIT**
  - **Description**: Pauses the workflow for a specified duration, allowing time for external events or conditions to occur.
  - **Use Case**: Wait 5 seconds for a window to load or a process to complete.

- **LOOP**
  - **Description**: Repeats all children steps for a set number of times or not.
  - **Use Case**: Click a button repeatedly or iterate over a list of items.

- **SUB_FLOW_STEP**
  - **Description**: Executes a nested sub-flow, allowing modular and reusable flow segments within the main workflow.
  - **Use Case**: Run a pre-defined subroutine to handle a common process or a repetitive task.

- **WINDOW_MOVE**
  - **Description**: Moves a specified window to a new position on the screen.
  - **Use Case**: Relocate an application window to a specific coordinate (e.g., x:100, y:200).

- **WINDOW_RESIZE**
  - **Description**: Resizes a specified window to a given width and height.
  - **Use Case**: Adjust a window to 800x600 pixels to ensure consistent UI element positioning.

- **TEMPLATE_SEARCH**
  - **Description**: Uses OpenCvSharp to search the screen (optional use of a flow parameter as the search area) for a single image template. If result accuracy is above the set value, the children under "Success" will be executed. Else the "Fail" children will be executed.
  - **TemplateMatchModes**: The following modes are available for template matching:
    | Mode                | Description                                                                 | Best For                          |
    |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
    | `TM_SQDIFF`         | Measures the squared difference;.                                           | Precise matching with exact sizes |
    | `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED`  | Normalized squared difference; accounts for lighting/scale differences.     | Robustness to brightness changes  |
    | `TM_CCORR`          | Computes correlation; higher values indicate better matches.                | Simple pattern matching           |
    | `TM_CCORR_NORMED`   | Normalized correlation; less sensitive to lighting changes.                 | General-purpose matching          |
    | `TM_CCOEFF`         | Correlation coefficient; measures similarity with zero-mean adjustment.     | Matching with contrast variance   |
    | `TM_CCOEFF_NORMED (Recomended)`  | Normalized correlation coefficient; robust to lighting and scale changes.   | High accuracy in varied conditions|
    
  - **Use Case**: Locate a "Reward" button icon on the screen to determine where to click.

- **MULTIPLE_TEMPLATE_SEARCH**
  - **Description**: Same as TEMPLATE_SEARCH but searches for multiple instances of an image template on the screen. "Success" or "Fail" children will be executed on every template image instance.
  - **Use Case**: Find all occurrences of different "Reward" icons in a list to perform actions.

- **WAIT_FOR_TEMPLATE**
  - **Description**: Same as TEMPLATE_SEARCH but executes continius comparisons until the specified image template appears on the screen.
  - **Use Case**: Wait up to 10 seconds for a "Loading" spinner to disappear before proceeding.

- **CURSOR_SCROLL**
  - **Description**: Scrolls the mouse wheel up,down,left,right by a specified amount.
  - **Use Case**: Scroll a webpage or listbox to reveal hidden content.

- **CURSOR_CLICK**
  - **Description**: Simulates a mouse click, click and hold, release for left, right buttons at the current cursor position.
  - **Use Case**: Click left button.

- **CURSOR_RELOCATE**
  - **Description**: Moves the cursor to a new position on the screen. Either manual (x,y coordinates) or by selecting the location of a template search result (step needs to have any TEMPLATE_SEARCH ancestor). 
  - **Use Case**: Position the cursor at the location of a specific template image.

- **GO_TO**
  - **Description**: Redirects the workflow to a previous step, enabling non-linear execution paths (May lead to unexpected infinite loops depending on your logic).
  - **Use Case**: Jump back to a previous step on failure or skip to a cleanup step.
